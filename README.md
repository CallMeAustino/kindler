# kindler

Kindler is a functional clone of Kickstarter, an online e-commerce site that allows users to create project ideas which can be funded by other users for various levels of incentives. Projects are given a deadline for a "fundraising" goal to be reached. Users also have the ability to leave comments on projects. Both users, and non-users can view projects, but only logged in users can back projects and/or leave comments.
